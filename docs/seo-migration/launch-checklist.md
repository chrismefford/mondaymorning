# SEO Migration Launch Checklist

## Monday Morning: mondaymorning-af.com Migration

### Pre-Launch (Complete Before DNS Switch)

- [ ] **Verify all redirect rules** in `public/_redirects` and `vercel.json`
- [ ] **Test 404 page** renders correctly with navigation
- [ ] **Confirm sitemap.xml** generates correctly at `/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] **Verify robots.txt** is accessible and correct
- [ ] **Check canonical tags** on all major pages point to `https://mondaymorning-af.com`
- [ ] **Test all internal links** work correctly
- [ ] **Verify HTTPS** is enforced (handled by hosting provider)

### DNS Configuration

**Add these records at your domain registrar:**

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 185.158.133.1 | 3600 |
| A | www | 185.158.133.1 | 3600 |
| TXT | @ | (generated by Lovable) | 3600 |
| CNAME | www | mondaymorning.lovable.app | 3600 |

**Recommended approach:**
1. Lower TTL to 300 (5 min) 24-48 hours before migration
2. Update DNS records
3. Wait for propagation (use [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org))
4. Verify site loads on new hosting
5. Raise TTL back to 3600+

### Google Search Console Setup

#### Immediately After Launch

1. **Add Property**
   - Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
   - Add `https://mondaymorning-af.com` as a property
   - Verify ownership via DNS TXT record or HTML file

2. **Submit Sitemap**
   - Navigate to Sitemaps in GSC
   - Submit: `https://mondaymorning-af.com/sitemap.xml`

3. **Request Indexing** for key pages:
   - `/` (Homepage)
   - `/shop`
   - `/about`
   - `/locations`
   - `/blog`
   - `/recipes`

4. **Monitor Coverage Report**
   - Check daily for first 2 weeks
   - Look for crawl errors, 404s, redirect issues
   - Fix any "Excluded" URLs that should be indexed

#### If Changing Domain (not applicable if keeping mondaymorning-af.com)
- Use **Change of Address** tool in old GSC property
- Point from old domain → new domain
- Keep old property active for 180 days minimum

---

### Post-Launch Monitoring (First 30 Days)

#### Week 2-4: Weekly Checks

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Redirect loops | Circular redirect rules | Check `_redirects` for conflicting patterns |
| Soft 404s | Page returns 200 but looks like 404 | Use proper 404 status code |
| Redirect chains | A→B→C instead of A→C | Update source redirect to point directly to final |
| Mixed content | HTTP resources on HTTPS page | Update all asset URLs to HTTPS |
| Slow redirects | Too many redirect hops | Flatten to single hop |

---

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

1. Revert DNS to point to old Squarespace site
2. Document what failed
3. Fix issues in staging
4. Re-attempt migration

Keep old Squarespace site live (but hidden) for at least 30 days post-migration.
